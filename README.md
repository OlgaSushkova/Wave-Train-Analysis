# Wave-Train-Analysis
Using 2D and 3D AUC diagrams we provide improved detection accuracy of Parkinson's disease

There are the matlab files to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and tremorogram data.

The idea of the method of wave train electrical activity analysis is that we consider the biomedical signal as a combination of the wave trains. The wave train is an increase of the power spectral density of the signal localized in time, frequency, and space. We detect the wave trains as the local maxima in the wavelet spectrograms. We do not consider wave trains as a special kind of signal. 

We investigate the following wave train parameters: wave train central frequency, wave train maximal power spectral density, wave train duration in periods, and wave train bandwidth. We have developed special graphical diagrams, named AUC diagrams, to determine what wave trains are characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases.
